<p><b><u>4/22/2022. The most normal and simply extraordinary thing.</b></u></p>

<p>Most of us have probably met people who say that they don't need religion because they find God in all things already, and anything else just drags down the whole experience of the divine. On the other hand, there are people who commit jihad or participate in religiously-charged violence. Passivity from a lack of zealousness on one hand, and then over-zealousness on the other. Since all action follows one's belief, I think that the belief about God in question is this: is God the most ordinary thing, or is He the most extraordinary thing? As a good Catholic boy, I must answer: both. 
</p>

<p>Starting from the lower (physically speaking) end of this spectrum, I learned this especially one day whenever I was in college, my junior year. I appreciated the chaplain that I had that year, because his spirituality leaned towards this end of the "spirituality spectrum." After spending enough time with him, I was graced with the experience of walking between the buildings on campus and being captured by the beauty of the trees that surrounded me. If I remember correctly, it wasn't even spring, because springtimes at my school were always spectacular. No, just some plain old trees, their sturdiness – faithfulness, even – their elegance. I knew God was present to me in that moment, and that He gave me this lovely vision to understand that He is present to me in a direct kind of way, but He is also mediated, reflected and glorified by His creation. His continued connection to His creation – not a substantial equality, as if He is only the sum of the parts of creation – is part of the reason for the fittingness and beauty of the Lord's coming in the flesh. He is terribly humble, reaching down to write in the dirt or picking up earth to heal the blind.
</p>

<p>He is terribly humble, but terribly "other." He is also the one whom Moses could not fully see, the one whose very being can destroy the unclean. He is the one who is completely and utterly set apart – that is, holy. He created all that has been, is and will be and sustains all that exists. Omnipotent and omniscient, Lord of Lords, King of Kings... but also the one who died on a cross, who was counted among the wicked, pierced for our offenses.
</p>

<p><a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2020/05/30/paradox/">Someone has said that "paradox is truth standing on her head to attract attention," [CLICK]</a> and in no other situation could this be more fitting than for the Lord who is our God, who is almighty and yet all-humble, who is indeed truth Himself. All Christians must find the balance between knowing God as almighty and Jesus also as brother who has taken on our flesh. The Eucharist can be a good start for developing this sense, as it is another place where He is present in all His glory, yet "stoops" to pass through our teeth and tongues to nourish us.

<p>So moral of the story, I like Catholicism because it's sane in ways like this. If you would like to fight me in a game of Quake over what I have written, <a href="../about.html">please contact me during my office hours.</a></p>
