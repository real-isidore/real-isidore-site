<p><b><u>5/10/2022. Sin, grace and control: or, how I learned to stop worrying and love The Fall.</b></u></p>

<p>It was pretty fitting that one of the most important things I've learned recently was in the sanctuary of a church.
</p>

<p>The little insight hit me like a pound of bricks. Really nice, wise, incorporeal bricks - you know the type. It became clear to me that all of my tireless striving towards sinless has been completely misguided, and I came to know this fruitless quest for what it is: an attempt to control my relationship with God, and maybe even to try and control God Himself.
</p>

<p>Every time I've tried to make out my sin as something worse than it really is, that I've somehow irrevocably cut myself off from God (to put my sense of sin in exaggerated terms), it wasn't me being righteous and recognizing my sin for what it really is. This kind of feeling has been me focusing only on myself and not the love of God.
</p>

<p>Ever since then I feel almost offended at the amount of references to God's love for us - that includes me - that I've noticed in the liturgy recently this Easter season... like I'm being targeted, har har. But anyone with this view of sin is constantly being targeted to have this view dismantled, just listen to any of collects in Mass or the liturgy of the hours. "For God has bound everyone over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all." You think you're the worst sinner? Wrong. We're all in the same boat. We all have found ourselves estranged from God, and that's kind of the whole point of Jesus showing up.
</p>

<p>Recently in speaking with someone about the story of the woman caught in adultery described in the middle of the Gospel according to John, I mentioned how despite the message of mercy contained in Jesus pointing out the sinfulness in all those who condemned the woman, I could never get over the fact that the story ends with Jesus telling the woman, "go and sin no more." After all that mercy and leveling of the spiritual playing ground, so to speak, Jesus would end with the admonition to go and not sin again? For me it becomes fuel for self-hatred that I can't follow this command or fatalistic excuse-making. However, the person with whom I was speaking was kind enough to point out, "but Jesus will just do the same thing over and over. He didn't say, 'don't sin again, this is the last straw!' - but if, or maybe when, the woman messed up again, Jesus will come over, pick her up again, give his advice, and all would move on again." The one who has the most trouble moving on whenever sin abounds is not God, it's us. Going back to Saint Paul, "where sin abounds, grace abounds all the more..." (That's the "loving the fall" part, in some sense. "O happy fault, o truly necessary sin of Adam that merited such and so great a redeemer," from the Easter Exsultet)
</p>

<p>The one who has the most trouble moving on whenever sin abounds is not God, it's us... no one can save himself. Although we're called to move ever closer to the Lord, the advice I heard from a homilist one time, speaking mostly to Catholic seminarians, could be useful for more of the faithful to keep in mind if this is something that continues to bother: "stop thinking that you're not gonna be saved." If you're someone who's going to Mass all the time, actively helping people when needed and keeping up some kind of prayer life, yearning for a deeper connection with the Lord... "stop thinking that you're not gonna be saved." 
</p>

<p>The one who has the most trouble moving on whenever sin abounds is not God, it's us. Next time you mess up and try and turn back to Jesus, know that you'll need to ask Him to do the heavy lifting. People try and fix things. It's been made clear that we can't fix many major things, and sin is one of these things. Pray that I can heed my own advice.
</p>

<p>The person who has the most trouble moving on whenever sin abounds is not Jesus, it's us.
