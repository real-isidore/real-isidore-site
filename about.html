<b>About This Website and Its Creator</b>

<br>

<p>Lots of people say it's good to have creative outlets, and I agree! Funnily enough, one thing that scratches my creative itch is making poorly designed websites reminiscent of the time when it was socially acceptable to make poorly designed websites (but at the same time, it was not socially acceptable to be the type of person who actually knows how to make a website) â€“ back when your boss would be completely fine with a web designer making a site like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970615085653/http://www.lego.com/">this</a>. Who greenlit that?! We as a species did not know any better. At least it loads very quickly. It was a time of innocence, and there were also No Problems at That Time Ever. Especially not for me when that site linked above was made, because I was very much Not Physically Present on Earth in 1997.</p>



<p>Anyways, I like doing all sorts of things in my free time, as you may see in the "My Creations" section. I've written music, I've made a game or two (and then more that were NOT made...), I've made videos and above all I'm a Roman Catholic, as you can find evidence of in the "Prayers" section. And then "Collections" is where I put links to other interesting sites, or maybe some GIFs or maybe also some Gouda Cheese. Please do not eat my cheese, I am saving that for later.</p>

<p>I'd be interested to hear from you about life, religion, philosophy, video games, music, outdoor activities, technology and cooking. If it has anything to do with politics (ESPECIALLY in Venezuela), please do not contact me about that.</p>
